# icforge

## ICForge
ICForge is a no-code platform that allows users to easily deploy and manage token standard smart contracts on the Internet Computer. This project leverages the Motoko programming language for smart contract development.

## Features
- **TokeDeployment:** Users can configure and deploy supported token standard smart contracts without writing code.
- **Canister Management:** ICForge automatically creates and manages canisters for users, allowing them to control and interact with their deployed smart contracts.
- **User-friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive web interface for users to input configurations and manage their token contracts.
